# Python Study Notes

This is a repository for study notes I have written while trying to learn Python from [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/). I have decided to learn the language in order to broaden my skill set as a programmer and to be able to handle projects where Node JS (my usual language) isn't feasible.

## Foreword

At first glance, Python is quite similar to C# and JavaScript so transitioning between the three languages isn't too hard once you've wrapped your head around one of them. It appears to uphold a 'less is more' philosophy which would be ideal for writing quick and simple scripts in order to just *do* something. I have been meaning to learn a scripting language for those sorts of things. Node JS can do just about anything in the right hands but I sort of miss writing linear, synchronous code, whereas one of Node's selling points is it's [non-linearity](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/control-flow/how-to-write-asynchronous-code/). In other words, I don't always enjoy writing callbacks and promises. I'm not saying Python cannot be asynchronous and I'm sure there are equivalents within that ecosystem. However, Python was introduced during a simpler time, so one might argue it has a simple charm in comparison to all of the fancy frameworks we have today. To me, Python is one of those languages that is simply about getting things done. As much as I love Node JS, I'm afraid it still falls short in that regard.

[I was going to write an extended rant about how much I miss the computing landscape back in the 90s and how things have changed dramatically since then but I don't think anyone actually wants to read about my sad opinions so I'll shut up for now. Please send help...]

## Disclaimer

This repository is licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal. These study notes are based on the [Python language tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) from W3Schools. Therefore, I cannot claim any personal copyright over the contents. I simply converted the notes to markdown and made them available here for archiving purposes.

I wrote these notes for myself as part of my own self-learning and, as such, may not be useful for everybody. I did not undertake the *whole* tutorial. I glossed over or outright skipped sections that do not fit with my programming style. Since all of the notes are derived from the W3Schools tutorial, it was unnecessary to cite individual pages. The basic structure and content is similar enough that cross-referencing shouldn't be difficult. However, I did link the individual pages when I copied the example code directly, such as in [chapter 9](./chapters/09-dictionaries.md#nesting-example-1) for nested dictionary properties.

As mentioned, I wrote these notes for myself and are by no means perfect. I will not be actively maintaining this repository but I will consider revising things if I feel the overwhelming need to do so. Since this is licensed under CC0 and I claim no copyright, you may do whatever you want.
