# Chapter 23 - User Input

---

## Prompting
* Python allows us to ask the user for input.
* To do this, use the `input()` function.
* Consider this particular example:
	* First, the command line asks for the username.
	* After the username has been entered, it is printed on screen.

```python
enteredUser = input("Username: ")
print(enteredUser)
```

## Waiting
* The 'input' function causes Python to stop executing.
* It waits for input, and continues after it has been entered.
