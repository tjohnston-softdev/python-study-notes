## What is Python?
* Programming language created by Guido van Rossum
* First released in 1991
* Used for:
	* Server-side web development.
	* Software development.
	* Mathematics.
	* System scripting / automation.

  

## Use Cases
* Creating web applications on a server.
* Used alongside software to create workflows.
* Connecting to databases.
* Reading and modifying files.
* Used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
* Rapid prototyping.
* Production-ready software development.

## Why Python?
* Works on different platforms. (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc)
* Simple syntax similar to English.
* Can write programs in fewer lines compared to other languages.
* Runs using an interpreter.
	* Code can be executed as soon as it is written.
	* This makes prototyping quicker.
* Procedural, functional, and object-oriented programming styles.

## Syntax Summary
* Designed for readability
* Similar to English and influenced by mathematics.
* Uses line breaks to complete a particular command.
* Relies on indentation, using whitespace to define scope.
* With most other languages:
	* Brackets are used to define scope.
	* Indentation is only for show.

## Checking Version
