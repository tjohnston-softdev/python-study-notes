## Assignment
| Operator | Example | Same as |
|---|---|---|
| = | x = 5 | x = 5 |
| += | x += 3 | x = x + 3 |
| -= | x -= 3 | x = x - 3 |
| /= | x /= 3 | x = x / 3 |
| %= | x %= 3 | x = x % 3 |
| //= | x //= 3 | x = x // 3 |
| \*\*= | x \*\*= 3 | x = x \*\* 3 |

## Comparison

| Operator | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| and | Both statements are True | x < 5 and x > 10 |
| or | At least one statement is True | x < 5 or x < 4 |
| not | Reverses result. Returns False if statement is True | not(x < y and x > 10) |

## Identity
